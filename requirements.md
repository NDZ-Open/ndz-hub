**Prompt for Replit Design Mode (NDZ Hub site)**

Build a high-end, cinematic organisation website for **NDZ Hub**, a nation builders movement and university-based builder community. The site should feel like a serious, modern institution (think YC + a civic organisation), with beautiful typography and bold, confident layout.

**Overall layout and style:**

* Full-screen **vertical scroll-snap** layout. Every main section is `100vh` and snaps cleanly on scroll.
* Dark, atmospheric design with **white text on deep, muted backgrounds**.
* Use **clean sans-serif typography** (Inter or similar), with strong hierarchy and tight tracking on headlines.
* Use subtle **Framer Motion–style animations** (fade up, slide in, smooth transitions).
* Design for **desktop first**, but responsive on mobile.
* Add a fixed **top navigation bar** with the menu items:

  * About NDZ
  * Programs
  * University Chapters
  * Opportunities
  * Resources
  * Contact

Clicking a menu item smoothly scrolls to its section.
